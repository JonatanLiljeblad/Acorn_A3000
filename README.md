# AcornA3000-Emulator

A Java-based emulator for the **Acorn A3000** — a classic ARM-based personal computer from the late 1980s. This project aims to faithfully emulate the A3000’s hardware, including the **ARM2 CPU**, memory subsystem, video output, and I/O devices, enabling RISC OS to run just like on the original machine.
